# Tic Tac Tow

> You can play Tic-Tac-Toe with this application. My purpose was to only build it with Javascript. There are no global variables. Almost every method is single responsible. 

### How To Remove Event Listeners?

> I am storing event listeners in an array at the moment of creation.
> When I want to remove them, I am using that array to address them.
